All the messages are inside the script "BilingBuilder_txtmsg.js"
It's better not to change the script, it's easy to forget some quote (my experience). 

If you want to improve the translation or add a new translation (by the way the existing ones are almost interely obtained by using google translator)

modify the file "BilingBuilder_msg_xx.txt  where xx it's a language   (or add a new one) 

and then run	 
     "BilingBuilder_message_script_making.html" 


It writes a  new file named "BilingBuilder_txtmsg.js.txt" on the download folder. 


Rename and copy it in the BilingBuilder folder   (before you'd better save the old one).

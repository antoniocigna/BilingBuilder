(.009)) Paste the <b> source </b> text below on the left and the <b> translation </b> on the right
(.010)) Also paste the <b> title </b> and any <b> web address </b> (they are not mandatory, but recommended) <br>
(.011)) Press the <b> RUN </B> button
(.012)) Check for any reports, it is not certain that there are really mistakes, correct if necessary <br>
(.013)) View the <b> previews </b> produced and possibly <b> download </b> the related files
(.014)) <br> The problems are probably due to an incorrect automatic subdivision of the text lines.
<br> When you press the RUN key for the first time, the text is divided into sentences and each sentence is rewritten in a single line
which begins with a 3-digit progressive number preceded by an opening parenthesis and a period and followed by two closing parentheses.
<br> For example <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;  &lpar;.023&rpar;&rpar;   this is one line.
<br> In the runs following the first one, the pair the pair brackets-period is considered the beginning of a new line to which a new progressive is assigned.
<br> For example the line  &lpar;.024&rpar;&rpar;   sentence number one  &lpar;.sentence number two
<br> becomes
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &lpar;.024&rpar;&rpar;   sentence number one
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &lpar;.025&rpar;&rpar;   sentence number two <br>
(.015)) Lines can be broken or joined together.
(.016)) A line can be broken by inserting an opening parenthesis followed by a period <B>&lpar;.</B>
(.017)) Two consecutive lines can be joined by eliminating the opening parenthesis, period, number and closing parentheses preceding the second line.
(.018)) <br> For example, to make the two lines into one:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lpar;.024&rpar;&rpar;sentence number one
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lpar;.025&rpar;&rpar;sentence number two<br>just remove &lpar;.025&rpar;&rpar; of the second line.
(.019)) page address or url (optional)
(.020)) If an error is reported in a pair (for example very different length of the two lines),
<br> probably a sentence has been erroneously broken (e.g. a period considered at the end of a sentence while in reality it was used for something else),
to correct it is necessary to join two successive lines by eliminating the opening brackets, period, number and closing brackets that precede the second line.
<br> or two consecutive phrases have been considered as one, in which case they must be separated by inserting the pair brackets-period 
(no need to add a number)
<br> <br> Press the <b> EXECUTE </b> button to confirm the changes
(.021)) <br> and renumber the lines automatically.
(.022)) <br> Press the <b> Reset Texts </b> button to discard all changes and start over with the initial texts.

(.111)) The text is divided into pairs of lines, one in the source language and the other in translation.
(.112)) Two buttons allow you to hide or show a row or both.
(.113)) This file can be used for practice
(.114)) in understanding texts in a foreign language,
(.115)) in the repetition of sentences by heart.
(.116)) A possible use could be:
(.117)) Read a sentence and try to guess its meaning.
(.118)) Press the red button to see the translation.
(.119)) The green button is used to hide the source language version,
(.120)) can be used for repetition exercises with or
(.121)) without the hint of the translated sentence.
(.122)) Changes the background color, font size and color
(.123)) The source text and its translation have been restored to their initial value (all changes have been undone)

(.136)) The file name ending <b> _size1.0 </b> .html allows the user to easily change the font size after the downloading. 
		<br> The number after <b>size</b> is a multiplier, by renaming the file and changing this number, we change the original font size 
		 (e.g. <b> _size2.0</b>.html  doubles the size).
		<br> Numeric values from 0.5 to 3.0 are accepted

(.155)) if you want to change the color of the background or of the font.  
(.156)) If the size of the characters is not considered satisfactory for printing,
        you can change it by renaming the file name.
	<br> If the filename ends with <b> _size</b>XX<b>.html</b> where XX is a number,
	this number multiplies the size of the characters.
	<br> eg. if we change the final part of the name to _size2.0.html we double the size of the characters.

# BilingBuilder
BilingBuilder creates bilingual interlinear, interactive and printable text  from any source got by copying and pasting.

It splits texts in sentences and write  them in rows (one sentence, one row).

Each sentence in the original language is folllowed by its translation.  

## Objective: 
  BilingBuilder is meant to be used as a learning tool:
  1. to improve the reading understanding in a foreign language 
  2. to help memorize pieces of poetry or text by hiding and showing lines.   

## Output files
It creates two html output files:
1. interactive bilingual text:   
    each sentence of the source text is preceded by two buttons:
      * the first button (the red one) shows the translation of the sentence if pressed 
      * the second button (the green one) hide the source sentence if pressed
2. printable bilingual text:  
   each sentence is followed by its translation 
 
## Input
Input is provided by the user by copy and paste.
The translation text can be got from an automatic translator like Google's or  Microsoft's Bing 
or from an existing one. 

BilingBuilder tries to syncronize the source and translation texts automatically, 
but let the user to correct it if needed  (warnings are issued in case of doubts).
